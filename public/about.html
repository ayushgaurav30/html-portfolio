<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ayush Gaurav, and I hail from the vibrant city of Muzaffarpur in Bihar. One of my greatest passions is playing cricket, a sport that has been a significant part of my life and has taught me invaluable lessons in teamwork, perseverance, and strategy. Engaging in cricket not only helps me stay physically fit but also provides a much-needed break from my academic pursuits.</p>

 <p> Currently, I am in the 4th year of my B.Tech program. This phase of my education has been both challenging and rewarding, offering me numerous opportunities to develop my skills and knowledge in the field. As I approach the completion of my degree, I am excited about the future and the possibilities that lie ahead in my professional career.</p>
